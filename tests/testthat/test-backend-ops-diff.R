# Differential backend testing: every op ggmlR builds must agree with the CPU.

# backend with identical inputs and reports the normalized mean squared error.
# Each case is computed three times against the same allocated graph, so a
# fault that only shows on re-execution is caught -- both backend defects found
# in this package were of that kind (the first run matched exactly and later
# ones did not).

# Default: the subset of ops ggmlR actually uses in its layers, which takes
# seconds. Set GGMLR_TEST_ALL_OPS=1 to run every registered case.
