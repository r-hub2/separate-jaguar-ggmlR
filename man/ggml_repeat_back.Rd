\title{Repeat Backward (Graph)}
\usage{
ggml_repeat_back(ctx, a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctx}{GGML context}

\item{a}{Input tensor (gradients from repeated tensor)}

\item{b}{Target shape tensor (original tensor before repeat)}
}
\value{
Tensor with summed gradients matching shape of b
}
\description{
Backward pass for repeat operation - sums repetitions back to original shape.
Used for gradient computation during training.
