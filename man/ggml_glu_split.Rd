\title{Generic GLU Split (Graph)}
\usage{
ggml_glu_split(ctx, a, b, op)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctx}{GGML context}

\item{a}{Input tensor (the values to be gated)}

\item{b}{Gate tensor (same shape as a)}

\item{op}{GLU operation type (GGML_GLU_OP_REGLU, GGML_GLU_OP_GEGLU, etc.)}
}
\value{
Tensor with same shape as input tensors
}
\description{
Creates a graph node for GLU with separate input and gate tensors.
Unlike standard GLU which splits a single tensor, this takes two separate tensors.
