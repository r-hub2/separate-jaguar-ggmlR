Description: Provides 'R' bindings to the 'GGML' tensor library for efficient
    machine learning computation. Implements core tensor operations including
    element-wise arithmetic, reshaping, and matrix multiplication. Supports
    neural network layers (attention, convolutions, normalization), activation
    functions, and quantization. Features optimization/training API with
    'AdamW' (Adam with Weight decay) and 'SGD' (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
    optimizers, 'MSE' (Mean Squared Error) and cross-entropy losses.
    Multi-backend support with CPU and optional 'Vulkan' GPU (Graphics
    Processing Unit) acceleration.
    See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more information about the
    underlying library.
