Description: Provides 'R' bindings to the 'GGML' tensor library for efficient
    machine learning computation. Implements core tensor operations including
    element-wise arithmetic, reshaping, and matrix multiplication. Supports
    neural network layers (attention, convolutions, normalization), activation
    functions, and quantization. Features optimization/training API with AdamW
    and SGD optimizers, MSE and cross-entropy losses. Multi-backend support
    with CPU and optional 'Vulkan' GPU acceleration.
    See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more information about the
    underlying library.
