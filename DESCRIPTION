Description: An R port of the GGML library providing efficient tensor 
    operations for machine learning on CPU. Implements core functionality 
    of GGML, including element-wise arithmetic and basic tensor manipulation. 
    The package brings the lightweight and performance-oriented design of 
    GGML to the R environment for fast numerical computation and model 
    prototyping.
