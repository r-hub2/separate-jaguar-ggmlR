Description: Provides 'R' bindings to the 'GGML' tensor library for efficient
    machine learning computation. Implements core tensor operations including
    element-wise arithmetic, reshaping, and matrix multiplication. Supports
    neural network layers (attention, convolutions, normalization), activation
    functions, and quantization. Features multi-backend support with CPU and
    optional 'Vulkan' GPU acceleration. See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml>
    for more information about the underlying library.
