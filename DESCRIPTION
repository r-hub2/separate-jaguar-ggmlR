Description: An R port of the 'GGML' library providing efficient tensor 
    operations for machine learning. Implements core functionality 
    including element-wise arithmetic, tensor manipulation, and 
    multi-backend support. Brings lightweight, performance-oriented 
    design to 'R' for fast numerical computation and model prototyping.
    See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more information
    about the underlying library.
