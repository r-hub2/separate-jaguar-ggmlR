Description: Provides 'R' bindings to the 'GGML' tensor library for machine
    learning, designed primarily for 'Vulkan' GPU acceleration with full CPU
    fallback. 'Vulkan' support is auto-detected at build time on Linux (when
    'libvulkan-dev' and 'glslc' are installed) and on Windows (when 'Vulkan
    SDK' is installed and 'VULKAN_SDK' environment variable is set); all
    operations fall back to CPU transparently when no GPU is available.
    Implements tensor operations, neural network layers, quantization, and a
    'Keras'-like sequential model API for building and training networks.
    Includes 'AdamW' (Adam with Weight decay) and 'SGD' (Stochastic Gradient
    Descent) optimizers with 'MSE' (Mean Squared Error) and cross-entropy
    losses. Also provides a dynamic autograd engine ('PyTorch'-style) with
    data-parallel training via 'dp_train()', broadcast arithmetic, 'f16'
    (half-precision) support on 'Vulkan' GPU, and a multi-head attention layer
    for building Transformer architectures. Serves as backend for 'LLM' (Large
    Language Model) inference via 'llamaR' and Stable Diffusion image
    generation via 'sdR'. See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more
    information about the underlying library.
