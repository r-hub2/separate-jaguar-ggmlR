Description: Provides 'R' bindings to the 'GGML' tensor library for machine
    learning with CPU/GPU 'Vulkan' acceleration. 'Vulkan' GPU support is
    auto-detected at build time on Linux (when 'libvulkan-dev' and 'glslc' are
    installed) and on Windows (when 'Vulkan SDK' is installed and 'VULKAN_SDK'
    environment variable is set). Implements tensor operations, neural network
    layers, quantization, and a 'Keras'-like sequential model API for building
    and training networks. Includes 'AdamW' (Adam with Weight decay) and 'SGD'
    (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizers with 'MSE' (Mean Squared Error)
    and cross-entropy losses. Serves as backend for 'LLM' (Large Language
    Model) inference via 'llamaR' and Stable Diffusion image generation via
    'sdR'. See <https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml> for more information about
    the underlying library.
